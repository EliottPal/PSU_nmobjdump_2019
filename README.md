# PSU_nmobjdump_2019

## Goal of the project:  
The goal is to code an equivalent to the system commands ***nm*** without any options and ***objdump*** with *-fs* option.  
You must handle a variable number of parameters.  
The display produced MUST be the same as the one on your dump.  
The programs must work with the following:  
    • relocatable files.o&.a  
    • shared files.so  
    • executable files
  
  
## Achievement:  
**Note:** **16.6**
